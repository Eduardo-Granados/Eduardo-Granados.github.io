#### Rules:
```
The goal of the OverTheWire games is to provide educational resources to people willing to learn
topics on cybersecurity. The OverTheWire community hosts these resources free of charge for players
to use and learn from. However, usage of these resources comes with a few simple rules.
In general

    Treat everyone with respect. We will not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination.
    We do not allow unsolicited spam or self-promotion in the chatrooms or private messages.
    Do not spoil the game for others in the chatrooms. If you need help, specify the game and
    level and someone will help you in private messages. Do not rely on Discordâ€™s /spoiler
    functionality as the chatrooms are connected to IRC where this functionality is not available.
    Do not use easy to guess file or directory names and clean up after yourself. If you have
    created files or directories, please remove them when you are done.

For educators and content-creators

    Do not publish credentials to any of the games. We understand the need to create writeups,
    walkthroughs, and tutorials, but do not publish any credentials.
    If you are profiting from the content you create and you are able to afford it,
    please consider donating a portion of your earnings to the OverTheWire community.
    We are a community of volunteers which relies on donations to keep the lights on.
    Please give credit where credit is due. If you are using content from the OverTheWire games,
    please mention the OverTheWire community and provide a link to our website.
